            <p class="p-desc">"Each human being is born with limitless potential, but our systems trap many in poverty. Poverty is not created by
                the
                poor; it’s a failure of institutions.
                If we can design inclusive systems that empower individuals, we can transform lives.
                Let’s build a world where no one is left behind, and poverty exists only in museums.
                Social business is the answer to many of the world’s problems—it’s about purpose, not profit.
                By unleashing the creativity and energy of people, we can solve global challenges.
                The future is in our hands; let’s make it a bright one for everyone."</p>
